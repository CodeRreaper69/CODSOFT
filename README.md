# Data Science Projects Showcase

## Introduction

I am Sourabh Dey, a second-year undergraduate student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. This repository showcases my projects in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science, completed as part of the Codesoft Internship opportunity. Each project is organized in separate folders as per the given tasks.

## Projects

1. **TASK_1 - Titanic Survival Prediction**
   - In this project, I built a model using the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not. The project involves data analysis, preprocessing, and classification techniques.

2. **TASK_2 - Movie Rating Prediction with Python**
   - This project focuses on predicting movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors. Regression techniques are employed to analyze historical movie data and develop an accurate rating estimation model.

3. **TASK_3 - Iris Flower Species Classification**
   - Using the Iris dataset, I developed a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on sepal and petal measurements. This project is a classic introductory classification task.
