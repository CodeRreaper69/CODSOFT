# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using logistic regression. The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as age, sex, class, and survival status.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeRreaper69/CODSOFT_DATA_SCIENCE
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd CODSOFT_DATA_SCIENCE/TASK_1
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Run the `titanic_prediction.py` script to perform data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

```bash
python titanic_prediction.py
or
python3 titanic_prediction.py
```

2. Follow the prompts to input the age and sex of an individual passenger, and the script will predict whether they would have survived the Titanic disaster.

## File Structure
- `titanic_prediction.py`: Python script containing data preprocessing, model training, and prediction code.
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: Dataset containing information about Titanic passengers.
- `README.md`: This file, containing information about the project.
